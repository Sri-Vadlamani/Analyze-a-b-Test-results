### Project Title
 Analyze A/B Test Results

### Description
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Files used
**The files used to analyze the statistical data are**
- ab_data.csv
- countries.csv

### Software used:

 **The following software is used in order to complete this project:**
- Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Statistical Analysis
- Probability
- Bootstrapping sampling distributions and p-value calculations
- Logistic regression

### Conclusions
- There was no evidence suggesting that those who explore either page would necessarily lead to more conversions
- The country of the user did not impact the rate of conversion between the two pages

### Credits
-	Udacity course material
- Stack overflow when encountered some errors.
-	Random web forums
